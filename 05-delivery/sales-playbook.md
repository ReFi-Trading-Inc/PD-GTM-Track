# Sales Playbook (Retail & Enterprise)

## Retail Sales Process (Self-Serve + Light Touch)

### Lead Generation
- **Inbound:** LinkedIn content (3x/week), Reddit AMAs (bi-weekly), TikTok (daily)
- **Outbound:** None initially, focus on organic + word-of-mouth

### Qualification (BANT)
- **Budget:** $150-$995/month range
- **Authority:** Self-directed trader (decision-maker)
- **Need:** 2+ years experience, $20K+ account, emotional trading pain
- **Timeline:** Immediate (alpha), 30 days (revenue)

### Sales Cycle: 7-14 Days
1. **Discover (Landing Page):** User reads value prop, sees social proof
2. **Engage (Email Sequence):** 5 emails over 10 days (education, proof, testimonials)
3. **Activate (Broker Connect):** User connects broker, starts paper trading
4. **Convert (Go Live):** After 7 days paper, graduate to live with $100 cap
5. **Expand (Upgrade):** After 30 days, prompt upgrade Starter → Pro or Pro → Prime

### Objection Handling
- **"Too expensive":** Compare to Bloomberg ($100K+/year) or time saved (15-20 hrs/week @ $50/hr = $3K/month value)
- **"Don't trust AI":** Show 3.1-year backtest results + zk-proofs + non-custodial architecture + human-in-the-loop control
- **"Too risky":** Progressive caps ($100 start) + kill switch + human confirmation on every trade + cryptographic risk limits
- **"Prefer manual trading":** "Think of it as an AI co-pilot, not autopilot. You're still in control of every trade."
- **"Regulatory concerns":** "We're a technology provider, not a broker-dealer. Validated with CIRO, SEC, and ADGM regulators. Non-custodial architecture means we never touch your assets."
- **"AI is a black box":** "We provide high-level explanations for every trade - why the AI made the decision, what signals it detected, and cryptographic proof of risk compliance. Not a black box."
