## Slide 9: Regulatory Strategy
**Technology Provider Classification = Regulatory Advantage**

**Non-Custodial = Reduced Regulatory Burden:**
- ✅ NOT a broker-dealer (no custody of client assets)
- ✅ NOT an investment advisor (no discretionary trading)
- ✅ Technology provider with human-in-the-loop oversight
- Validated with 3 regulators: CIRO (Canada), SEC (USA), ADGM (UAE)

**Compliance by Design:**
- Human-in-the-loop: Every trade requires user confirmation (CSA 11-349 compliant)
- Explainable AI: High-level trade logic explanations (not black box)
- Cryptographic audit trail: zk-proofs + event sourcing + IPFS logs
- Progressive safety: $100 → $500 → $5K caps + kill switch

**Launch Sequence (Regulatory Arbitrage):**
1. **UAE/GCC (Q1 2026):** ADGM FinTech RegLab - best clarity, 3-4 month approval
2. **Canada (Q2 2026):** CIRO Regulatory Sandbox - SnapTrade partnership, 2-3 week approval
3. **USA (Q4 2026):** Post-validation launch - SEC FinHub filing with proof package

**Compliance Budget:** $67-87K Year 1 (vs $500K+ for broker-dealer registration)

**Token Deferred:** $REFIN launch post-Series A 2027 (avoid security classification complexity)
