## 🎯 The Problem

**Retail traders have the knowledge and capital to succeed, but emotional decision-making and time constraints prevent them from executing their own strategies consistently.**

---

## 📊 Problem Breakdown

### 1. Emotional Trading is the #1 Barrier to Success

**Evidence:**
- 16/18 interviewed traders (89%) cited emotional decision-making as biggest weakness
- "I have a system that works on paper (58% win rate), but I deviate in real-time" - Power-Retail Trader #2
- "I exit too early when scared, hold too long when greedy" - Power-Retail Trader #1

**Impact:**
- Rational strategies become irrational in execution
- Winners turn into losers because of fear/greed
- Traders know the problem but can't fix it manually

---

### 2. Trading is Time-Intensive

**Evidence:**
- Average: 15-20 hours/week spent on trading
- "I can't be glued to screens all day while working" - Power-Retail Trader #2
- Professional income ($150K-$500K) makes time extremely valuable

**Impact:**
- Trading consumes nights and weekends
- Opportunity cost of $75-250/hour
- Burnout and fatigue over time

---

### 3. Institutional Tools are Inaccessible to Retail

**Evidence:**
- "We're too small for $1M+ infrastructure" - Fund Manager #1
- "Best traders are machines. I can't afford a quant team." - Power-Retail Trader #5
- Hedge funds use RL algorithms; retail uses TradingView indicators

**Impact:**
- Retail traders at permanent disadvantage
- No access to advanced strategies
- Limited to manual execution

---

### 4. Post-FTX Custody Paranoia

**Evidence:**
- 17/18 traders (94%) mentioned FTX unprompted
- "After FTX, I'll never give my keys to anyone again" - Power-Retail Trader #2
- Median loss: $8,000 per trader in FTX collapse

**Impact:**
- Trust in centralized platforms destroyed
- API key access feels risky
- Non-custodial is table stakes, not feature

---

## ❌ Why Existing Solutions Fail

### Manual Trading
- ❌ Emotional decisions in real-time
- ❌ Time-intensive (15-20 hrs/week)
- ❌ Can't compete with algorithms

### TradingView Strategies
- ❌ Alert-based (still requires manual execution)
- ❌ No risk enforcement
- ❌ No cryptographic proofs

### Copy Trading (eToro, etc.)
- ❌ Custodial (must deposit funds)
- ❌ Following strangers (no control)
- ❌ Post-FTX trust destroyed

### Robo-Advisors (Betterment, Wealthfront)
- ❌ Passive strategies only (not active trading)
- ❌ No momentum/swing trading
- ❌ Low returns (8-10% annually)

### Alpaca / Algo Trading APIs
- ❌ Require coding expertise
- ❌ No pre-built RL models
- ❌ No risk proofs
- ❌ Alpaca unavailable in Canada

   - Every trade cryptographically proven safe before execution
   - On-chain audit trail
   - Math can't lie

3. **Reinforcement Learning (Not Rules-Based)**

   - Trained on 3.1 years of data (28.06% CAGR, 2.07 Sharpe)
   - Institutional-grade algorithms

4. **Progressive Caps (Safety by Design)**
   - Day 1-2: $100 max
   - Day 3-6: $500 max
