# Positioning Document

## Category
Non-Custodial AI Trading Technology Provider (new category)

## For Whom
Power-retail traders with $50K-$250K accounts and 5-10 years experience

## Key Insight
Post-FTX, sophisticated traders want institutional-grade AI but refuse to give up custody. Regulatory clarity requires explainable AI with meaningful human oversight.

## Positioning Statement
"For experienced traders who refuse to compromise on custody, ReFi.Trading is the only AI trading technology provider that delivers Wall Street-grade algorithms while you keep your assets at your own broker. Unlike robo-advisors or copy trading, we prove our safety guarantees cryptographically with zero-knowledge proofs and maintain regulatory compliance through explainable AI with human-in-the-loop oversight."

## Competitive Alternatives
1. Manual trading (status quo for most)
2. QuantConnect (backtest-only, DIY)
3. Composer (rules-based automation)
4. Wealthfront (custodial robo-advisor)

## Unique Differentiation
Non-custodial + Live RL + zk-Proof Risk + Regulatory Compliance = Trust through mathematics AND transparency

## Regulatory Classification
**Technology Provider** (not broker-dealer, not investment advisor)
- No custody of client assets
- Human-in-the-loop confirmation required
- Explainable AI with transparent audit trails
- Cryptographically enforced risk limits
