# Messaging Guide

## Primary Message
"Wall Street AI with Regulatory Clarity"

## Core Pillars
1. **Non-Custodial:** Your assets stay at your broker (IBKR, Alpaca, Kraken)
2. **AI-Powered:** Institutional-grade RL trained on 3.1 years (28% CAGR, 2.07 Sharpe)
3. **Cryptographically Safe:** zk-VaR proofs enforce risk limits before every trade
4. **Progressive Trust:** Start with $100, scale to $5K+ as you build confidence
5. **Regulatory Compliant:** Technology provider model with explainable AI and human oversight

## Audience-Specific Messages

### Power-Retail Traders (Primary ICP)
"Stop trading on emotions. Let AI handle execution while you keep custody and control. Start with just $100."

### Fund Managers (Secondary ICP)
"Get hedge-fund-grade quant infrastructure without the $10M build cost or regulatory headaches. $50K/year vs. $350K+ DIY."

### Regulators (Influencer)
"Technology provider model with non-custodial architecture, human-in-the-loop confirmation, explainable AI, and cryptographic audit trails. Compliance by design, not afterthought."

## Do Say
✅ "Non-custodial technology provider" (regulatory classification)
✅ "AI co-pilot" (not autopilot - emphasizes human oversight)
✅ "Cryptographic safety proofs" (builds trust)
✅ "Explainable AI" (regulatory requirement)
✅ "Human-in-the-loop confirmation" (CSA 11-349 compliant)
✅ "Transparent audit trail" (regulatory friendly)
✅ "Progressive caps with kill switch" (safety controls)
✅ "Historical backtest performance" (factual, not predictive)

## Don't Say
❌ "Fully autonomous AI" (regulatory red flag - SEC/CIRO concern)
❌ "Set it and forget it" (implies no oversight)
❌ "Guaranteed returns" (illegal in Canada/USA)
❌ "No risk" (misleading - use "cryptographically enforced risk limits")
❌ "Get rich quick" (attracts wrong audience)
❌ "Revolutionary" (overused, unsubstantiated)
❌ "Secret algorithm" (contradicts transparency message)
❌ "Black box AI" (regulatory concern - emphasize explainability)

## Regulatory Messaging Framework

### When Speaking to Regulators:
1. **Lead with classification:** "We're a technology provider, not a broker-dealer"
2. **Emphasize non-custody:** "We never touch client assets - they stay at regulated brokers"
3. **Highlight human control:** "Every trade requires user confirmation via human-in-the-loop"
4. **Show transparency:** "Full audit trail with cryptographic proofs of risk compliance"
5. **Demonstrate safety:** "Progressive caps, kill switches, and explainable AI decisions"

### When Speaking to Investors:
1. **Regulatory clarity as moat:** "UAE/GCC first - clearest regulatory framework"
2. **Validated compliance:** "Confirmed with CIRO, SEC, and ADGM regulators"
3. **Scalable model:** "Technology provider classification enables multi-jurisdiction expansion"
4. **Reduced risk:** "$30-40K legal budget vs. $500K+ for broker-dealer registration"
