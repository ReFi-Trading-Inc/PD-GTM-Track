# Regulatory Alignment Notes
**Based on 3 regulator interviews + legal research**

## Key Regulatory Wins

### Canada (CIRO)
✅ Non-custodial = NOT dealer registration required  
✅ Human-in-the-loop satisfied via "Confirm" button  
✅ SnapTrade = compliant DEA intermediary  
✅ Regulatory sandbox available (2-3 week application)

**Action Items:**
- Hire Canadian securities lawyer ($15-20K) - Osler or McCarthy Tétrault
- Apply to CIRO sandbox Week 16
- Build audit trail (event sourcing + IPFS logs)

### UAE (ADGM)
✅ RegLab FinTech Sandbox = 6-12 month testing window  
✅ Cat-4 license appropriate for our model  
✅ Token-friendly jurisdiction (clearest crypto regulations)  
✅ **RECOMMENDED FIRST LAUNCH** - best clarity

**Action Items:**
- Engage ADGM lawyer ($10-15K) - Al Tamimi & Co
- Apply to ADGM RegLab Week 8
- Prepare technical documentation for RegLab application

### USA (SEC)
⚠️ More complex, defer to Month 9+  
✅ Non-custodial helps avoid Customer Protection Rule  
⚠️ Avoid "fully autonomous" language (use "AI co-pilot")  
⚠️ Token likely Howey Test security, defer to 2027

**Action Items:**
- USA launch Month 9+ (after UAE + Canada proof)
- Use alpha results as regulatory proof of concept
- Engage US securities lawyer when ready ($25-35K) - Cooley or Fenwick

## Regulatory Strategy Timeline
**Month 1-3:** UAE/GCC alpha launch (ADGM clarity)  
**Month 4-6:** Canada expansion (CIRO sandbox)  
**Month 9-12:** USA launch (proof-of-concept established)  
**2027+:** Token launch (Series A, clearer regulations)
