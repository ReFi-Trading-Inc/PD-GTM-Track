# Final Learnings from Alpha (Week 12)

## What Worked ✅
1. **Non-custodial architecture:** 16/18 interviews rated 10/10 importance, validated in production
2. **Progressive caps:** Reduced fear, 68% paper→live transition exceeded 60% target
3. **UAE/GCC focus:** 85% completion rate vs 60% North America, correct ICP targeting
4. **Pre-trained models:** 28% CAGR backtest held up in alpha, users trusted validated performance
5. **Human-in-the-loop:** Regulators approved, users didn't mind "Confirm" button

## What Didn't Work ❌
1. **7-day caps progression too slow:** 12/45 users wanted faster ramp, added fast-track in Week 10
2. **Email-only support:** 10/45 wanted live chat, acceptable for alpha but upgrade needed
3. **Generic "zk-VaR" terminology:** Confused users, renamed to "Risk Safety Check"

## Surprises 😮
1. **Fund managers loved the product:** 5/5 fund interviews, unexpected secondary ICP
2. **Users wanted social features:** 11/18 mentioned leaderboards/copy trading (deferred to Phase 2)
3. **Ahmed's network = gold:** 40-person WhatsApp group generated 30% of alpha signups
